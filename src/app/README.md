## Environment and Prerequisites

### Local Development Requirements
All development is expected to be done from Visual Studio Code in a Windows or Mac environment.

- Flutter
- Visual Studio Code
  - We recommend validating your components using this [Flutter guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install).
- For local iOS compilation and debugging, you need access to Mac with Xcode 14.2 (more recent versions may work too).

### Pipelines Requirements
The pipelines (for continuous integration, testing, and delivery) of this project are made for [Azure Pipelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/get-started/what-is-azure-pipelines?view=azure-devops).

#### Required Knowledge
If you're unfamiliar with Azure Pipeline, you should at least read about the following topics.
- [Key Concepts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/get-started/key-pipelines-concepts?view=azure-devops)
- [Set a secret variable in a variable group](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/set-secret-variables?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml%2Cbash#set-a-secret-variable-in-a-variable-group)
- [Add a secure file](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/library/secure-files?view=azure-devops#add-a-secure-file)

#### Required Infrastructure
- You need an Azure DevOps organization project with Pipelines enabled.
  - You can follow [this guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/get-started/pipelines-sign-up?view=azure-devops) for more details.
- For compilation, access to the the following [Microsoft-hosted agents](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/hosted?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml) is required.
  - `windows-2022`
  - `macOS-13`
- For deployment, access to Mac agents with the following capabilities is required.
  - `fastlane 2.212.1`
