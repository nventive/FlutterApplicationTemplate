# Flutter Application Template

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg?style=flat-square)](LICENSE)

This is a mobile app project template using [Flutter](https://github.com/flutter) and the latest Flutter/Dart practices.

## Requirements

Visual Studio Code with Flutter are required.

This template largely relies on Flutter, if you want to make sure you got everything installed correctly on your machine, we encourage you to use `flutter doctor -v`, the documentation is available [here](https://docs.flutter.dev/)

## Getting Started

We use a Dart CLI application to easily create new projects.

### Generate a new project

1. Fetch all dependencies.

   Change directory to src/app in the terminal, and run these following commands:

   `flutter pub get`
   `dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`
   `flutter gen-l10n`

3. Install the CLI using this command.

   `dart pub global activate flutter_application_generator`

4. Create a new project using this command.

    `flutter_application_generator create --destinationDirectory C:\P --projectName MyProjectName --applicationName MyAppName --packageName com.example.myAppName --organizationName MyOrg`

   > 💡 The organization parameter is optional (Only used for the Windows platform).

   > 💡 You'll need internet access to create new projects.

   The following options are available when running the command.

   - To get help: `flutter_application_generator --help`

   - To show version: `flutter_application_generator --version`

### Next Steps

1. Open the `README.md` and complete the documentation TODOs.
2. Open the directory with Visual Studio Code.
